The following questions have been posed to guide our analysis and inform decision-makingðŸ’¡
# tools i used:
1. Python:
   - Primary programming language for data analysis.
   - Versatile and efficient environment for handling and manipulating datasets.

2. Pandas:
   - Powerful data manipulation library in Python.
   - Enables efficient loading, cleaning, and transformation of datasets.

By utilizing these tools effectively, I was able to perform in-depth analysis of the sales data, extract valuable insights, and support data-driven decision-making for the electronic store.

The questions I wanted to answer through (pandas,matplotlib,python) were:

Question #1: What was the best month for sales? how much was earned this month?

Question #2: What city sold the most product? 

Question #3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?

Question #4: What products are most often sold together?
